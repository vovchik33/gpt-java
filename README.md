This project was created to help others learn Java from scratch, and this course is based on GPT.

## Structured Roadmap for Learning Java

### 1. Java Basics

- Introduction to Java and its history
- Installing Java Development Kit (JDK) and setting up an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
- Writing and running your first Java program (Hello World)
